# ðŸŽ“ About  
This repository contains the projects I completed as part of **Harvardâ€™s CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript** .
This course is a continuation of CS50, focusing on web development using Python and JavaScript. It covers various technologies such as Django, React, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and SQL. Additionally, the course introduces Git for version control, best practices in software development like testing and CI/CD, as well as security and scalability aspects of web applications. Participants will have the opportunity to apply their learning by building their own web applications.
